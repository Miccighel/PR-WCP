	<abstract>In this paper we study the identification of an event region X within a larger region Y, in which the sensors are distributed by a Poisson process of density λ to detect this event region, i.e., its boundary. The model of sensor is a 0-1 sensor that decides whether it lies in X or not, and which might be incorrect with probability p. It also collects information on the 0-1 values of the neighbors within some distance r and revises its decision by the majority vote of these neighbors. In the most general setting, we analyze this simple majority vote scheme and derive some upper and lower bounds on the expected number of misclassified sensors. These bounds depend on several sensing parameters of p, r, and some geometric parameters of the event region X. By making some assumptions on the shape of X, we prove a significantly improved upper bound on the expected number of misclassified sensors; especially for convex regions with sufficiently round boundary.</abstract>

The k-Precolouring Extension problem is to decide whether a colouring of a subset of a graph’s vertex set can be extended to a k-colouring of the whole graph. A k-list assignment of a graph is an allocation of a list — a subset of {1,…,k} — to each vertex, and the List k -Colouring problem asks whether the graph has a k-colouring in which each vertex is coloured with a colour from its list.

In our model, a dynamic path network consists of an undirected path with positive edge lengths, uniform edge capacity, and positive vertex supplies. Here, each vertex supply corresponds to a set of evacuees. Then, the problem requires to find the optimal location of k sinks in a given path so that each evacuee is sent to one of k sinks. Let x denote a k-sink location. Under the optimal evacuation for a given x, there exists a (k − 1)-dimensional vector d, called (k − 1)-divider, such that each component represents the boundary dividing all evacuees between adjacent two sinks into two groups, i.e., all supplies in one group evacuate to the left sink and all supplies in the other group evacuate to the right sink. Therefore, the goal is to find x and d which minimize the maximum cost or the total cost, which are denoted by the minimax problem and the minisum problem, respectively. We study the k-sink location problem in dynamic path networks with continuous model, and prove that the minimax problem can be solved in O(kn logn) time and the minisum problem can be solved in O(kn 2) time, where n is the number of vertices in the given network.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>path network</kph><kph>k-sink location problem</kph><kph>dynamic path</kph><kph>location problem</kph><kph>k-sink location</kph><kph>dynamic path networks</kph><kph>problem</kph><kph>network</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>A relaxation-based algorithm for solving the conditional p-center problem. </cite><cite>An efficient algorithm for evacuation problem in dynamic network flows with uniform arc capacity. </cite></cites></article><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><article><author>Yinfeng Xu</author><title>Semi-online Hierarchical Load Balancing Problem with Bounded Processing Times.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_21</ee><abstract>In this paper, we consider the online hierarchical scheduling problem on two parallel machines, with the objective of maximizing the minimum machine load. Since no competitive algorithm exists for this problem, we consider the semi-online version with bounded processing times, in which the processing times are bounded by an interval [1,α] where α ≥ 1. We prove that no algorithm can have a competitive ratio less than 1 + α and give an optimal algorithm with the competitive ratio of 1 + α. Moreover, if we further know the sum of jobs’ processing time in advance, we prove that no algorithm can have a competitive ratio less than α where 1 ≤ α &lt; 2, and we also propose an algorithm which is shown to be optimal for the case 1 ≤ α &lt; 2.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>minimum machine load</kph><kph>hierarchical scheduling problem</kph><kph>processing times</kph><kph>hierarchical scheduling</kph><kph>online hierarchical scheduling</kph><kph>scheduling problem</kph><kph>algorithm</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>The hierarchical model for load balancing on two machines. </cite><cite>Online and semi-online hierarchical scheduling for load balancing on uniform machines. </cite><cite>Parallel machine scheduling under a grade of service provision. </cite><cite>Semi-online scheduling on 2 machines under a grade of service provision with bounded processing times. </cite><cite>Semi-online scheduling with two GoS levels and unit processing time. </cite><cite>Online and semi-online scheduling of two machines under a grade of service provision. </cite></cites></article><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><article><author>Wei-Sheng Zeng</author><title>Protein Name Recognition Based on Dictionary Mining and Heuristics.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_8</ee><abstract>We propose a novel method that integrates dictionary, heuristics and data mining approaches to efficiently and effectively recognize exact protein names from the literature. According to the protein name dictionary and heuristic rules published in related studies, core tokens of protein names can be efficiently detected. However, exact boundaries of protein names are hard to be identified. By regarding tokens of a protein name as items within a transaction, we apply mining associations to discover significant sequential patterns (SSPs) from the protein name dictionary. Based on SSPs, protein name parts are extended from core tokens to left and right boundaries for correctly recognizing the protein name. Based on Yapex101 corpus, Protein Name Recognition System (PNRS) achieves the F-score (74.49%) better than existing systems and papers.</abstract><keyphrases></keyphrases><cites><cite>Protein names and how to find them. </cite><cite>Discovering patterns to extract protein-protein interactions from full texts. </cite><cite>a web-base</cite><cite>Combination of text-mining algorithms increases the performance. </cite><cite>Identification of related gene/protein names based on an HMM of name variations. </cite></cites></article><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><article><author>Elham Roshanbin</author><title>The Competitive Diffusion Game in Classes of Graphs.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_25</ee><abstract>We study a game based on a model for the spread of influence through social networks.

The best approximation algorithm has a factor O(lognlog* n) and it was shown most recently that it is FPT (but with a very high running time). In this paper, we consider the decision version of the one-sided MCSP problem (formally called the exact block cover problem); namely, when one sequence is already partitioned into k blocks, how to decide whether the other sequence can be partitioned accordingly. While this decision problem is obviously in FPT, we show interesting results in this paper: (1) If each letter is allowed to appear at most twice (or three times), then the problem is polynomially solvable, (2) There is an FPT algorithm which runs in O *(2 k ) time, improving the trivial bound of O *(k!), and (3) If |Σ| = c, c being a constant at least 2, then the problem is NP-complete.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>Common String Partition</kph><kph>Minimum Common String</kph><kph>String Partition</kph><kph>Common String</kph><kph>Minimum Common</kph><kph>algorithm</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>A fixed-parameter algorithm for minimum common string partition with few duplications. </cite><cite>Minimum common string partition parameterized by partition size is fixed-parameter tractable. </cite><cite>The greedy algorithm for the minimum common string partition problem. </cite><cite>The string edit distance matching problem with moves. </cite><cite>Minimum common string partition revisited. </cite><cite>The greedy algorithm for edit distance with moves. </cite><cite>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates. </cite><cite>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates. </cite></cites></article><Petr Kolman><author>Tomasz Walen</author><title>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates.</title><year>2007</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.05.011</ee></Petr Kolman><Petr Kolman><author>Tomasz Walen</author><title>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates.</title><year>2007</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.05.011</ee></Petr Kolman><Petr Kolman><author>Tomasz Walen</author><title>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates.</title><year>2007</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.05.011</ee></Petr Kolman><Petr Kolman><author>Tomasz Walen</author><title>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates.</title><year>2007</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.05.011</ee></Petr Kolman><Petr Kolman><author>Tomasz Walen</author><title>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates.</title><year>2007</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.05.011</ee></Petr Kolman><Petr Kolman><author>Tomasz Walen</author><title>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates.</title><year>2007</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.05.011</ee></Petr Kolman><Petr Kolman><author>Tomasz Walen</author><title>Approximating reversal distance for strings with bounded number of duplicates.</title><year>2007</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.05.011</ee></Petr Kolman><article><author>Adel Guitouni</author><title>A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Solving the Unsplittable Multicommodity Flow Problem: The Maritime Surveillance Case.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_13</ee><abstract>Large volume surveillance missions are characterized by the employment and collaboration of several agents processing diverse information sources’ inputs in order to ensure a surveillance task. Given the time dependant relevance of the shared information, an efficient global routing policy needs to be set up to optimize information exchange in the backbone of the surveillance network. We propose to model this problem as a single path multicommodity flow problem, where several commodities are to be shared in a capacitated network. The considered objective function is to minimize the overall network congestion. As the problem is NP-Hard, a hybrid genetic approach is proposed as a solution approach. A greedy search procedure based on the nearest neighbor method is transplanted into the genetic algorithm. The empirical validation is done using a simulation environment called Inform Lab. A comparison to a state-of-the-art ant colony system approach is performed based on a real case of maritime surveillance application and some randomly generated instances. The analysis of the results obtained in the two sets was supported by statistical nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The experimental results show that the hybrid genetic algorithm performs consistently well for large sized problems.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>diverse information sources</kph><kph>volume surveillance missions</kph><kph>Large volume</kph><kph>surveillance</kph><kph>set</kph><kph>Large volume surveillance</kph><kph>surveillance missions</kph><kph>problem</kph><kph>volume surveillance</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>An ant colony optimization metaheuristic for single-path multicommodity network flow problems. </cite><cite>Approximability of unsplittable shortest path routing problems. </cite><cite>A Multicommodity Network-Flow Problem with Side Constraints on Paths Solved by Column Generation. </cite></cites></article><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><article><author>Guohui Lin</author><title>Partially Dynamic Single-Source Shortest Paths on Digraphs with Positive Weights.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_18</ee><abstract>We examine several structural properties of single-source shortest paths and present a local search algorithm for the partially dynamic single-source shortest paths problem.

We derive mostly (worst-case) intractability results, even for very restricted cases (including trees or bounded-degree graphs) but also obtain a few encouraging fixed-parameter tractability results.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>data publishing</kph><kph>graph k-anonymous</kph><kph>vertex degree</kph><kph>undirected graph</kph><kph>dummy vertices</kph><kph>privacy-preserving data</kph><kph>study</kph><kph>incident edges</kph><kph>graphs</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>Why Waldo befriended the dummy? k-anonymization of social networks with pseudo-nodes. </cite><cite>Complexity of social network anonymization. </cite><cite>Invitation to Fixed-Parameter Algorithms. </cite></cites></article><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><article><author>Kenneth W.

This scenario applies also to symmetric functions f, where the partial derivatives approach zero as the corresponding component value increases. The goal is to pre-compute exact values f(u) on a tight enough net of sequence arguments, so that given any other sequence x, a neighboring sequence u in the net giving a close approximation can be efficiently found. Our scheme avoids pre-computing the more-numerous partial-derivative values. It employs a new data structure that combines ideas of a trie and an array implementation of a heap, representing grid values compactly in the array, yet still allowing access by a single index lookup rather than pointer jumping. We demonstrate good size/approximation performance in a natural application.</abstract><keyphrases></keyphrases><cites><cite>Space-efficient memo-functions. </cite><cite>Efficient memo-table management strategies. </cite><cite>Precomputation-based sequential logic optimization for low power. </cite></cites></article><Mazhar Alidina><author>Marios C.

In this paper, we study the general problem, i.e., minimax regret k-sink location problem in the dynamic path networks. Based on the algorithm for the 1-sink location problem, we design an \(O(n^2(\log n)^{1+\log k}C_n^{k-1})\) time algorithm for the general problem, where \(C_n^{k-1}\) is the number of combination choosing k − 1 from n.</abstract><keyphrases></keyphrases><cites></cites></article><article><author>Yixin Xu</author><title>The Garden Hose Complexity for the Equality Function.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_11</ee><abstract>The garden hose complexity is a new communication complexity introduced by H.

We focus on the garden hose complexity of the equality function, and improve on the bounds of O. Margalit and A. Matsliah [MM12] with the help of a new approach and of our handmade simulated annealing based solver. We have also found beautiful symmetries of the solutions that have lead us to develop the notion of garden hose permutation groups. Then, exploiting this new concept, we get even further, although several interesting open problems remain.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>hose</kph><kph>garden hose</kph><kph>garden hose complexity</kph><kph>hose complexity</kph><kph>garden</kph><kph>new communication</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>Position-Based Quantum Cryptography. </cite><cite>Position Based Cryptography. </cite></cites></article><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><><author></author><title></title><year></year><ee></ee></><article><author>Yong Zhang</author><title>Competitive Algorithms for Unbounded One-Way Trading.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_4</ee><abstract>In the one-way trading problem, a seller has some product to be sold to a sequence σ of buyers u 1, u 2, …, u σ arriving online and he needs to decide, for each u i , the amount of product to be sold to u i at the then-prevailing market price p i . The objective is to maximize the seller’s revenue. We note that most previous algorithms for the problem need to impose some artificial upper bound M and lower bound m on the market prices, and the seller needs to know either the values of M and m, or their ratio M/m, at the outset. Moreover, the performance guarantees provided by these algorithms depend only on M and m, and are often too loose; for example, given a one-way trading algorithm with competitive ratio Θ(log(M/m)), its actual performance can be significantly better when the actual highest to actual lowest price ratio is significantly smaller than M/m.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>then-prevailing market price</kph><kph>one-way trading problem</kph><kph>one-way trading</kph><kph>market price</kph><kph>trading</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>Dynamic Pricing with Limited Supply. </cite><cite>Item pricing for revenue maximization. </cite><cite>Welfare and Profit Maximization with Production Costs. </cite><cite>Dynamic and non-uniform pricing strategies for revenue maximization. </cite><cite>Optimal buy-and-hold strategies for financial markets with bounded daily returns. </cite><cite>Optimal search and one-way trading online algorithms. </cite><cite>Average-case competitive analyses for one-way trading. </cite><cite>On the Competitive Ratio of Online Sampling Auctions. </cite><cite>Competitive Algorithms for Online Pricing. </cite><cite>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items. </cite></cites></article><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><Yong Zhang><author>Hing-Fung Ting</author><title>Online pricing for bundles of multiple items.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-013-0043-4</ee></Yong Zhang><article><author>Leizhen Cai</author><title>Obtaining Split Graphs by Edge Contraction.</title><year>2014</year><ee>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-07956-1_19</ee><abstract>We study the parameterized complexity of the following Split Contraction problem: Given a graph G and an integer k as parameter, determine whether G can be modified into a split graph by contracting at most k edges.

However, proactive decisions should also match the users’ preferences to maintain users’ trust in the system. Wrong decisions could negatively influence users’ acceptance of a system and at worst could make them abandon the system. In this paper, a trust-based model, called User Trust Model (UTM), for automatic decision-making is proposed, which is based on Bayesian Networks. The UTM’s construction, the initialization with empirical data gathered in an online survey, and its integration in an office setting are described. Furthermore, the results of a user study investigating users’ experience and acceptance are presented.</abstract><keyphrases><kph>User</kph><kph>energy systems</kph><kph>Smart energy</kph><kph>Smart energy systems</kph><kph>support users</kph></keyphrases><cites><cite>Exploring issues of user model transparency and proactive behaviour in an office environment control system. </cite><cite>A survey of trust in social networks. </cite><cite>Comparative study of trust modeling for automatic landmark tagging. </cite><cite>Proc. </cite><cite>Dimensionality of information disclosure behavior. </cite></cites></article><Bart P.
